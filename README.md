An intelligent AI-powered revision engine that personalizes learning using skill modeling, probabilistic mastery tracking, performance analytics, and adaptive question recommendation.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The **Adaptive AI Revision Platform** dynamically models student knowledge and continuously updates mastery levels based on:

- Accuracy trends
- Confidence scores
- Time-based forgetting
- Concept-level performance
- Adaptive difficulty scaling

Designed for scalable EdTech systems, coding practice platforms, and competitive exam preparation tools.

## 🔥 Core Modules

### 🧠 Student Skill Vector (`skill_vector.py`)

Tracks per-student knowledge state including concept mastery (0–1), confidence score, attempt history, accuracy ratio, and time-based decay state.

### 📊 Performance Metrics Engine (`performance_metrics.py`)

Computes concept-level accuracy, recency-weighted performance, response time analytics, and confidence calibration.

### 📈 Mastery Update Engine (`mastery_update.py`)

Implements Bayesian Knowledge Tracing-inspired updates with confidence-weighted reinforcement and adaptive difficulty shifts.

### ⏳ Forgetting Curve Module (`forgetting_curve.py`)

Applies exponential decay to model memory retention over time:

$$\text{Retention} = e^{-\lambda t}$$

Where `λ` is the decay constant and `t` is time elapsed since last attempt.

### 📊 Analytics Generator (`analytics_generator.py`)

Produces weak-area detection, revision priority rankings, mastery heatmaps, and confidence progression trends.

## 🧩 Question Schema

```json
{
  "problem_statement": "Reverse a linked list recursively.",
  "concepts": ["Linked List", "Recursion"],
  "skills_tested": ["Pointer Manipulation", "Recursion Logic"],
  "difficulty": "Medium"
}
```

Supports multi-label classification, concept tagging, and difficulty adaptation.
